        "A big city with a lot of attractions, in front of the Mediterranean sea, with wonderful climate and food... that's Barcelona!\n",
        "\n",
        "Millions of tourists come to this city every year, in every season, to enjoy its beaches, go to its sport teams matches, and visit its most important museums (8 UNESCO World Heritage Sites). It is considered the most popular city to visit in Spain. However, this has a strong impact on the apartments value near to the most popular places: official actions have been taken by the mayor to moderate the problem (source: Wikipedia). \n",
        "\n",
        "This project will analyze the historical trend of the average rent and sell values in Barcelona districts from 2014 to 2018.\n",
        "Moreover, a geographical analysis of the districts will be setup, focusing on important facilities for residents and tourists: public transportation and bicing stations. An additional map layer will focus on main tourists attractions locations and venues explorations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Main goal is to understand better the tourism business impact on Barcelona residents' life and find an eventual correlation by house prices and facilities / points of interests nearby. \n",
        "\n",
        "Barcelona city administration could find it helpful for deeper understanding of the current status of the different districts / barrios and useful to check where additional improvements should be performed. Newcomers or investors could also use this project to evaluate the most profitable zones for investments."
